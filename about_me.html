<h1>Heather Miller</h1>
<h2>Age 18</h2>
<h5>My hobbies include but aren't limited to:  drawing, listening to music, making origami, playing my instrument, and doing pretty much anything computer related.  I listen to a lot of different types of music, from orchestral arrangements to 8-bit chiptunes.  I also work as a software developing intern for iit/Sourcetech.  I've learned a lot over the past summer, and I've really developed a passion for computer science.  I hope to continue my career by getting a bachelor's in Computer Science at UW-La Crosse.</h5>
